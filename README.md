├── frontend/    # React + Vite frontend
└── backend/     # Node.js + Express API
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Cloudinary account (for image uploads)
- Razorpay account (for payments — test mode works without a live account)

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values in .env
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

On first run, an admin account is seeded automatically using `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.
